# Machine Learning Models for Heat Hotspot Prediction

## Overview

This document provides research-based analysis of machine learning models suitable for predicting heat hotspots at the neighborhood level. Heat hotspot prediction is crucial for urban planning, public health, and climate adaptation strategies.

## Model Selection Criteria

When selecting models for heat hotspot prediction, we considered:

1. **Spatial Dependencies**: Ability to capture geographic relationships
2. **Temporal Patterns**: Handling time-series data and seasonal variations
3. **Feature Complexity**: Managing diverse data types (meteorological, geographical, urban)
4. **Interpretability**: Understanding which factors contribute to predictions
5. **Scalability**: Performance with large geospatial datasets
6. **Real-time Prediction**: Capability for operational deployment

## Recommended Models

### 1. Random Forest

**Strengths:**
- Excellent handling of mixed data types (numerical, categorical)
- Built-in feature importance ranking
- Robust to outliers and missing data
- No assumptions about data distribution
- Good performance out-of-the-box with minimal hyperparameter tuning

**Why it's suitable for heat hotspots:**
- Can capture complex interactions between urban features and temperature
- Handles geospatial features naturally
- Provides interpretable results for urban planners
- Works well with tabular data common in urban datasets

**Limitations:**
- May struggle with very high-dimensional data
- Can overfit with very deep trees
- Limited ability to extrapolate beyond training data range

### 2. Gradient Boosting (XGBoost/LightGBM)

**Strengths:**
- State-of-the-art performance on tabular data
- Excellent handling of feature interactions
- Built-in regularization to prevent overfitting
- Efficient training and prediction
- Superior feature importance and SHAP value support

**Why it's better than Random Forest:**
- Generally achieves higher predictive accuracy
- Better handling of imbalanced datasets (common in hotspot detection)
- More sophisticated feature interaction modeling
- Better calibrated probability estimates

**Use cases:**
- Primary model for highest accuracy requirements
- When interpretability through SHAP values is needed
- For operational systems requiring fast predictions

### 3. Neural Networks (Deep Learning)

**Strengths:**
- Can learn complex non-linear patterns
- Flexible architecture for different data types
- Can incorporate spatial convolutions for grid data
- Supports multi-task learning

**When to use over tree-based models:**
- When dealing with high-dimensional data (satellite imagery, weather grids)
- Need for multi-step ahead predictions
- Availability of large training datasets (>100k samples)
- Complex feature engineering requirements

**Limitations:**
- Requires more data and computational resources
- Less interpretable than tree-based models
- More sensitive to hyperparameter choices

### 4. LSTM Networks

**Strengths:**
- Specialized for sequential/temporal data
- Can capture long-term dependencies in weather patterns
- Supports variable-length sequences
- Can predict multiple steps ahead

**Why it's superior for temporal aspects:**
- Explicitly models temporal dependencies that tree-based models miss
- Can capture seasonal and cyclical patterns
- Handles irregular time series data
- Supports both historical and real-time predictions

**Best use cases:**
- Time-series forecasting of heat events
- When temporal context is crucial (e.g., heat wave development)
- Real-time alerting systems
- Multi-horizon predictions

## Recommended Ensemble Approach

For optimal performance, we recommend a multi-model ensemble:

1. **Primary Model**: Gradient Boosting for baseline predictions
2. **Temporal Component**: LSTM for capturing temporal dependencies  
3. **Spatial Component**: Convolutional Neural Network for spatial patterns
4. **Ensemble**: Weighted combination based on validation performance

## Implementation Priority

1. **Phase 1**: Random Forest (quick baseline, good interpretability)
2. **Phase 2**: Gradient Boosting (improved accuracy)
3. **Phase 3**: LSTM (temporal modeling)
4. **Phase 4**: Neural Networks (advanced spatial modeling)
5. **Phase 5**: Ensemble methods (optimal performance)

## Data Requirements

### Essential Features
- Temperature readings (current and historical)
- Geographic coordinates and elevation
- Urban characteristics (building density, green space)
- Temporal features (hour, day, season)
- Basic meteorological data (humidity, wind)

### Advanced Features
- Satellite imagery for land use classification
- High-resolution weather data
- Energy consumption patterns
- Traffic and human activity data
- Socioeconomic indicators

## Model Validation Strategy

1. **Temporal Split**: Train on historical data, test on future periods
2. **Spatial Split**: Train on some neighborhoods, test on others
3. **Cross-Validation**: Time-series aware cross-validation
4. **Metrics**: AUC-ROC, Precision-Recall, Spatial correlation
