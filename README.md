# Kilimani-Prop-Tech-2025: Climate-Responsive Urban Planning Tool

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
Rapid urban expansion is intensifying the urban heat island effect, heightening health risks and energy demands especially in vulnerable, underserved communities. This directly impacts constitutional environmental rights (Kenya Constitution 2010, Article 42) and requires compliance with environmental protection standards (EMCA).

## OUR SOLUTION
A predictive microclimate tool that combines satellite-derived variables with machine learning to forecast heat hotspots at the neighborhood level, supporting:
- Environmental Management and Coordination Act (EMCA) compliance
- Physical and Land Use Planning Act (PLUPA) 2019 integration
- Professional standards alignment (BORAQS, EBK, PPTEK)
- Constitutional environmental rights protection (Articles 42, 69, 70)

## STUDY AREA: KILIMANI WARD
